Display Multiple Plots

With the subplots() function you can draw multiple plots in one figure.

********************************************************************************
The subplots() Function:

The subplots() function takes three arguments that describes the layout of the figure.
The layout is organized in rows and columns, which are represented by the first and second argument.
The third argument represents the index of the current plot.

        plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    #the figure has 1 row, 2 columns, and this plot is the first plot.

        plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    #the figure has 1 row, 2 columns, and this plot is the second plot.


!!!!
So, if we want a figure with 2 rows an 1 column
(meaning that the two plots will be displayed on top of each other instead of side-by-side)
!!!!
