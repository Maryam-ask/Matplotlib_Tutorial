Multiple Lines

You can plot as many lines as you like by simply adding more plt.plot() functions.


You can also plot many lines by adding the points for the x- and y-axis for each line in the same plt.plot() function.
(In the examples above we only specified the points on the y-axis,
meaning that the points on the x-axis got the the default values (0, 1, 2, 3).)
